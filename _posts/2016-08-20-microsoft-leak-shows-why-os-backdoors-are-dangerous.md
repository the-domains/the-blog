      The past few years have been a bit of a challenge for Microsoft,
      especially if you listen to the tech journalists writing about the
      company. From what many consider a failed Windows 8 launch to the
      plummeting sales of desktop computers, you might think the glory days for
      the company are well in the past.

  Security researchers MY123 and Slipstream revealed this week that Microsoft
  accidentally leaked security keys that allow Windows-based computers, phones
  and tablets to be unlocked and loaded with other operating systems, as well as
  malicious software like rootkits. While the company has attempted to patch
  Windows to fix this, the researchers believe that it'd be impossible for
  Microsoft to render the leaked keys useless.
